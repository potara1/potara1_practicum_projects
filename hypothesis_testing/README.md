---
### Research Objective:
Test hypotheses created with the marketing department of a large online store, **launch an A/B test, and analyze the results.**
---
### Conclusion
**1. Top hypotheses based on the RICE framework:**
- Add a subscription form to all main pages to build an email client base.
- Implement product recommendation blocks on the e-commerce site to increase conversion rates and average order value.
- Introduce two new traffic channels to attract 30% more users.
- Display banners with current promotions and sales on the homepage to boost conversions.
- Launch a birthday discount promotion to drive more sales.

**2.** Based on **group performance graphs for August 2019, Group B consistently** outperformed Group A in revenue, average order value, and order quantity, particularly from August 16 onwards, indicating the positive impact of the test.

**3.** **Statistical significance analysis suggests stopping the test and confirming Group B's victory**, as there are significant differences between the groups. The changes implemented in Group B led to substantial improvements over Group A. Although there were no significant differences in average order value between the groups, Group B saw an 18.9% increase in order quantity.
