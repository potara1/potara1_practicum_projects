## Mobile app Analysis
--- 
### Research Objective   
  Identify the reasons for the company’s losses through an analysis of acquired users through **marketing metrics(LTV, ROI, САС)**  and help the company move towards profitability.  
---
### Summary:  
1. **Advertising is not profitable.** 
2. **Focus on poor performance in the following areas:**
   - **Devices** - IPhone and Mac
   - **Country** - USA
   - **Channels** -  AdNonSense, FaceBoom, and especially TipTop.  
4. **Profitability issues may stem from:**
   - Functional problems with iOS apps
   - Advertising relevance in the US
   - Uncontrolled growth in expenses for TipTop and FaceBoom, leading to unprofitability
   - Spending on channels that don’t align with the product's value.
5. **Improve performance for PC users**, possibly addressing issues with app authentication on PC.
6. **Consider further cooperation with channels** such as YRabbit, MediaTornado, lambdaMediaAds, and RocketSuperAds (especially for the US market), as they show positive ROI trends and declining CAC.
7. **YRabbit shows strong profitability metrics**, particularly in the summer, suggesting potential as a seasonal channel.
8. **Beyond the USA, consider the UK**, as users from this country have demonstrated positive ROI and LTV trends over the past six months.
